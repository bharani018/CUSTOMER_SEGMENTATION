K-means clustering is a method used to group data points into K clusters based on their similarities. It works by iteratively assigning each data point to the nearest cluster centroid and updating centroids until they stabilize. This algorithm aims to minimize the variance within clusters while maximizing the variance between them. K-means is widely used for segmentation and pattern recognition tasks in various fields such as data analysis, image processing, and customer segmentation.
